group effort\\
After watching \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8}{Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git} we made some notes.

\subsection{Notes Jeroen}
bitkeeper only commercial software which is distributed (around 14 May 2007).
GIT and mercurial are distributed as well.

GIT is fully distributed, every download and working is it's own branch (~15:15 min).
This is a different model which is far more stable and error proof than one central head.

Kernel acceptance is done by network-of-trust (~27:30 min). That's the way that people pull 
updates from each other, only if they trust them. And some are trusted by Linus so will some 
updates eventually come in the kernel.

GIT is focused on easy merging (~35:10 min). If a developer has made changes and the merge 
on a higher level has to many merge conflicts. A developer with knowledge of the code and 
expertise can execute it as well just as easy. 

Question about central version control system is cheaper and easier for small projects 
(~38 min). GIT reserves network traffic because of local branching. Naming branches in central 
based system causes more overhead than an distributed system.

GIT doesn't track a separate file, but the whole project as one (~44:15 min). Searching a 
specific file it will first find the global environment and search for file. This is a bit 
slower than other systems by the way GIT works.

In GIT it is possible to (~48:35 min) make a backbone GIT project and refer to other GIT 
projects. It is also possible to extract certain files of older branches.

Again some explanation that special attention was spend of the development of merging.
(~50:39 min). The system of branching works only well if merging is going well. If merging 
is an issue than branching is a bad decision.

GIT calculates a diff stat after a merge(~54 min). This gives information about the parts 
that have changed since the last merge.

GIT guarantees that unwanted changes (disk errors or whatever) are tracked and warned 
(~65 min). GIT uses SHA-1 but not in a security application but for keeping signatures of 
files. Applied for trusting data.

The development got hacked at bitkeeper (~59:10 min). When that happens you will pay 
attention to detect changes in codes.

Again a part not about tracking separate files but a overview of the whole(~1:03:17 min).

Code is tracked across files. Again an example of tracking with a greater overview and not 
in file level (~1:08:00 min). GIT can tell which code lines come from a file a couple of 
years ago.

I tried to watch the following youtube movie: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RECQJCebCA}\\
but it could not be found, see image \ref{fig:error_youtube}. For the placing the image \ref{fig:error_youtube} and wrapping this
text around it I used a explanation on Wikibooks.org\cite{wikibooks_figures}
